photos_data_table =
Using this script to help me label printed photos quickly, which was becoming really labour intensive.

If you have an album from google photos, you can export the album using Google Takeout.
This script will, when directed to the unzipped album folder, create an html showing a table with a thumbnail of the photo, the file name, the date the photo was taken and the location.
